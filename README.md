# 🌐 PolyVerse: Polymer Property Prediction Using Deep Learning

PolyVerse is a deep learning-powered web application that predicts key physical and chemical properties of polymers based on their SMILES notation. This project bridges materials science and AI, enabling efficient and accurate prediction of polymer behavior, thereby reducing the need for costly and time-consuming experiments.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Traditional computational techniques like DFT and MD simulations are slow and resource-intensive. PolyVerse tackles this by leveraging:

- A **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** trained on curated polymer datasets.
- **RDKit** for molecular fingerprint generation.
- A **MERN Stack** web interface for user interaction.
- Advanced deep learning models (initial experiments also explored Transformer architectures).

## 📌 Key Features

- Predicts properties such as:
  - **Tensile Strength**
  - **Ionization Energy**
  - **Electron Affinity**
  - **LogP (Partition Coefficient)**
  - **Refractive Index**
  - **Molecular Weight**
- SMILES-based input with automatic validation.
- Interactive frontend with prediction and analysis views.
- Authentication (Register/Login) system.
- Real-time prediction via Flask API backend.
